# Cool-videos
Videos that i think are cool
There's already a read me file in the .zip (gonna copy and paste it here instead, so you can just delete the read me file)
Buttt
yeah

Also the file "cool videos" file, that i'm uploading, has the frames to it aswell- so, i will update this, once I add some more videos that I think are cool
 
 
 I do not own any of these videos. These are videos, that I simply think are cool.
